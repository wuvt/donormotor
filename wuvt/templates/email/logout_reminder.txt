Hello {{ dj.airname }},

You were logged out of Trackman automatically due to inactivity. Please make
sure to use the Logout button in the upper right corner after finishing your
show. This is necessary to ensure that tracks played by automation are logged,
which is a licensing requirement.

Did you get this by mistake? If you're playing a track that's longer than 10
minutes or so, you should use the "Let me play longer songs" check box to
prevent this from happening.

Thanks!
