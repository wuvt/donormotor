# DonorMotor

This is a stub repository for WUVT's donation management platform, to be spun out of
[wuvt/wuvt-site](https://github.com/wuvt/wuvt-site).

Goals are to:

1. Provide more advanced donor tracking and handling
2. Provide better configurability of premiums
3. Better integrate with Stripe API

Further, this should provide an approachable framework for other stations looking to
adopt a simple donation platform (as AudienceEngine has never materialised), without
dragging in the relative bloat of wuvt-site (this is the same reason we spun out
trackman).

## TODO:

- Prune non-donation code from wuvt-site to populate this repo

## About the Name

DonorMotor is a pun off of [AudienceEngine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audience_Engine),
WFMU's vaporware donation management platform. It has a nice ring to it, and doesn't rely on
thermodynamics.
